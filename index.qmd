:::{#hero-heading}

I hold a **Ph.D. in Economics** from the **University of Naples Federico II**, where I specialize in an interdisciplinary blend of **Statistical Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, and Economics. My academic journey is rooted in the pursuit of clarity and effectiveness within the rapidly evolving field of data science.

### Research Focus

My research primarily explores the interpretability of algorithms, specifically in the fields of **Explainable Machine Learning (XML)** and **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**.
As machine learning models become increasingly integral to critical decision-making in sectors like finance and healthcare, the necessity for transparency is paramount. 
My work aims to make these powerful tools more understandable and accessible, with a keen interest in **decision-tree methods** appreciated for their simplicity and ease interpretation.

### Affiliations & Contributions

I am currently a member of the **Bibliometrix Research Team** and the academic spin-off **K-Synth**. Recently, I served as a **Visiting Scholar** at the Department of Methodology and Statistics at **Leiden University** (Netherlands).

My contributions have been recognized in publications in several international scientific journals. Alongside a talented team of colleagues, I actively work on developing innovative **open-source software packages** for the **R** programming environment.
