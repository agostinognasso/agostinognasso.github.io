My academic journey is rooted in the pursuit of clarity and effectiveness within the rapidly evolving field of data science.\n\n\nMy research primarily explores the interpretability of algorithms, specifically in the fields of Explainable Machine Learning (XML) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). As machine learning models become increasingly integral to critical decision-making in sectors like finance and healthcare, the necessity for transparency is paramount. My work aims to make these powerful tools more understandable and accessible, with a keen interest in decision-tree methods appreciated for their simplicity and ease interpretation.\n\n\n\nI am currently a member of the Bibliometrix Research Team and the academic spin-off K-Synth. Recently, I worked as a Visiting Scholar at the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Leiden University (Netherlands).\nMy contributions have been recognized in publications in several international scientific journals. Alongside a talented team of colleagues, I actively work on developing innovative open-source software packages for the R programming environment."
